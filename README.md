<h3> button tag vs input type=”button” attribute </h3>

The <input type=”button”> and <button> tag are two different approach to use Button in HTML document. The difference between them is that the buttons created with the <button> tag offer many contributing possibilities than <input type=”button”> attribute.<br>

Just as a side note, <button> will implicitly submit, which can cause problems if you want to use a button in a form without it submitting. Thus, another reason to use <input type="button"> (or <button type="button">).<br>

There are 3 supported types for a button



```diff
+  submit ||  "submits the form when clicked (default)"
+  reset  ||  "resets the fields in the form when clicked"
+  button ||  "clickable, but without any event handler until one is assigned"
```
